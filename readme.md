A must-use plugin for wordpress that modifies the wordpress admin area using php snippets. Removes the needs for customising the wordpress config.php file, which gets overwritten every update. These are snippes that I've written and picked up over the years. It is well documented, so copy what you need.

## Install

* Copy and edit the modules you need into a php script.

* Create a directory named `mu-plugins` inside the wp-content directory with permissions set at 755.

* Put your php script inside the folder and it should appear on the Must-Use tab of your Wordpress plugins page.

To disable any section simply comment it out or delete the script. For the matomo sections you will need a matomo analytics install and your own api key from it to [create the widgets](https://matomo.org/docs/embed-matomo-reports/).
